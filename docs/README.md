# Lattice documentation

Choose a route based on what you want to do. The [project README](../README.md) introduces Lattice and the story systems you can build.

## Start using Lattice

1. [Quick start](lattice-workspace.md) — install the extension in SillyTavern, send your first reply, review it, and save your workflow.
2. [Operator’s manual](operators-manual.md) — learn the canvas, node settings, Preview, connections, subgraphs, and file commands through illustrated instructions.
3. [30 example workflows](examples.md) — choose a lesson, configure its requirements, and try a complete workflow in a practice chat.

For a particular node, click its **?** button in the editor. Its guide explains the purpose, settings, connections, and examples beside your work.

## Build a story system

| Guide | Use it to… |
| --- | --- |
| [Story systems](story-systems.md) | Build a weighted chaos wand, gradual relationships, private perspectives, timed events, or an accepted campaign notebook. |
| [Unified workflows](unified-workflows.md) | Connect preparation and reply processing, combine reusable systems, and manage memories, documents, clocks, and accepted changes. |
| [Model setup and troubleshooting](native-workflows.md) | Choose a connection for each model tool, understand request budgets, and investigate reply or save problems. |
| [Reference tools and workflow library](lattice-reference-library.md) | Apply style or terminology references, inspect repeated wording, and reuse context or cleanup tools. |
| [Connections and workflow comments](connection-comments.md) | Follow typed connections and label, move, or resize sections of the canvas. |
| [Node reference](node-reference.md) | Look up the complete inputs, outputs, controls, and limits when you need detail beyond the in-editor guide. |
| [Introspection](introspection-package.md) | Work with character reflection, memories, and state. |

For common settings, see [familiar node settings](operators-manual.md#familiar-node-settings). For recorded results, see [Read Preview](operators-manual.md#read-preview). The [Pattern lesson](unified-workflows.md#detect-and-filter-a-reply) shows how to detect terms and filter paragraphs without an extra model request.

## Develop or contribute

- [Developer guide](developer-guide.md) — architecture, rendering, local setup, checks, and contribution guidance.
- [Development commands](development.md) — build and verification commands, including documentation capture tools.
- [API and contracts](api/README.md) — proposed node plugin and companion HTTP contracts, the interface inventory, and the versioning policy.
- [Commit message form](commit-form.md) — the SDD/ICS template, its notation, and worked examples.
- [Asset jobs](api/asset-jobs.md) — the OpenJD-shaped job, resource, priority, cancel, and manifest spike.
- [Documentation media](media.md) — screenshot and animation inventory and how to reproduce the captures.

Screenshots use synthetic story material on the real local editor. The research and superpowers directories retain historical working records; use the user guides above for current operation.

## Workflow design records

These records explain the unified-workflow design, including proposals and open choices. An optional design alternative is not necessarily an available control. The [unified workflow guide](unified-workflows.md) describes the implemented authoring path.

| Document | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Workflow Unification Summary](design/workflow-unification-summary.md) | The lifecycle from preparation to publication, file updates, recall, story time, runtime, and host integration. |
| [Expanded Nodes](design/expanded-nodes.md) | Proposed node contracts and story recipes for triggers, decisions, files, recall, clocks, progression, and relationship pacing. |

## Cartography and rendering design

| Document | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [ComfyUI runtime](design/comfyui-runtime.md) | How ComfyUI starts, where its configuration lives, how models are discovered, and the RAM/VRAM budget rule. |
| [MOSS atlas ontology](design/cartographers-moss-atlas-ontology.md) | How the Cartographers' Locus Frame, Witness Plate, and Scale Register map onto MOSS layouts and reference images, including the GGUF caveat. |
| [Map geometry spec](design/map-geometry-spec.md) | Proposed geometry model for map declarations: typed primitives, an explicit frame, topology, and parent-map transforms. Not implemented. |
| [Cartographers archival register](design/cartographers-archival-register.md) | The historical register for Cartographers prose: pipe-roll formulae, diplomatics, and how they map onto the commit contract. Proposal. |
| [Cartographers source library](design/cartographers-source-library.md) | Public-domain editions (Gutenberg, archive.org) behind the lore register, with line-level citations usable in fragment `evidence` blocks. |

Implemented requirements and validation appear in the [requirement evidence](design/workflow-unification-requirements.md) and [release report](superpowers/reports/2026-10-10-workflow-unification.md).
